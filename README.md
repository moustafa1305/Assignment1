# Changing generic elements to their semantic counterparts

## Project definition

The task for this assignment was to change the code of the html and CSS files of a webpage to meet accessibility standards, while not changing the how the webpage looks or runs.
This was done by using semantic elements in the source code to make it easier to understand.
Make sure the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
Check that attributes fall in sequential order.
